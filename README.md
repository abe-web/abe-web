# Welcome to my GitHub Page
Hello, I've began my programming journey in May 2020, as a 'Junior Web Developer'.

## Experience
* My first job in the technology sector was with the Marine Corps Reserve as a Data Systems Administrator.  
I was an actively drilling reservist from 2016 - 2022. 
* I learned a lot regarding Operating Systems, the command prompt, Networking, Active Directory, Imaging Computers, The Linux OS, Unix OS, among other things.

* My second job in tech was as a IT Helpdesk technician. 
This job was in Chicago and I worked solving issues over the phone and in-person. 
* I learned to troubleshoot computer hardware, networking hardware, telecomm hardware and installed a lot of different types of software. This was my first time installing an Operating Systems over a network, and automation with Powershell.

* Current Job as a Back-end Web Developer 
I was offerred a job as a Junior Web Developer in 2020. I felt it was similar to a paid intership, as the first 3 months, I began as a contractor. Prior to being offered the job, I was instructed to complete part a small project in the Elixir Language. It was an extremely steep learning curve, but I did well and passed the job interview. 


## Technologies

### Languages I've used at work
- Elixir
- SQL
- PHP
- Perl

### Languages I'd like to eventually be proficient in 
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust

### Starting from scratch

I'm also taking on the task to learn Web Development from the very beginning. As a back-end dev, I don't get to see the full process of a website creation, so I'd like to learn all the can, starting as a beginner.
